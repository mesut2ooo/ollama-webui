However, if you want to use this system effectively within a pirate context (like talking like one), it would be best served with more general knowledge about programming concepts rather than specific technical details related to AI systems such as Deepseek Coder model developed by the company for answering computer science-related questions and tasks in an ethical manner.\n"
