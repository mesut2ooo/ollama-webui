In computer science, this is typically the first step in learning a new programming language or framework like Python/Java etc., and should be done as soon as possible after gaining basic understanding of concepts such variables declaration (var), loops (\"for\", if statement) along other fundamental constructs - arithmetic operations ('+', '-'), comparison operators('==' '!=') amongst others. \n\nAssuming you are asking for an HTML page, the following code can be used as a starting point:\n```html\n<"

      "content": "Sure thing here is your request in terms of creating and running this \"Hello World\" script. In web development (which I assume you are referring to), HTML documents usually contain text content enclosed within the `body` tags, for example - \n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang='en-us'> \n  <head> </ head >  \n    <title>Page Title < / title > \n   < body style = \"font:14px sans serif; color:#333;\" >  Hello World !  The current time is : + new Date ( ) ;   \n<!DOCTYPE html, defined in the first line of HTML. It provides basic styling information for documents written with HTML. < / head >  < body>  \"Hello world\" can be translated into multiple languages including English and many other non-English ones as well - a text that is visually pleasing to humans while machine learning algorithms read from left to right without missing characters, making it ideal when used in contexts such as user interface design. < /body>  </html> \n``` \nIn the code snippet above: `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares this document using HTML5 and makes sure that different browsers render these tags appropriately - not necessary for most common use-cases, but very helpful if you are planning to make your website responsive. Also note '+ new Date () +' will display current date & time when user opens the webpage in their browser which is useful as a timestamp of last modification/update on server side also this may vary according how servers handle request for \"Hello World\" page .\n"
